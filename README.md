The API was created with Android Developer Tools v22.6.2-1085508. It is targeted for Android 4.4.2 (API 19) SDK with Android 4.3 (API 18) as the minimum required SDK and requires a JDK compiler compliance level of 1.7.  To build the library:

1. Import the project into Eclipse  
2. Check that the JDK compiler compliance level is 1.7  
   * This can be view and/or changed in the project properties menu, under the "Java Compiler" section  
3. Select Project -> Build Project from the top menu  

The build will produce a jar file, metawearapi.jar, in the bin folder.
